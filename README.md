# CraftWeek

From daily notes to weekly clarity.

CraftWeek is a lightweight reflection tool that transforms Craft daily notes into a structured weekly summary — saved directly inside Craft.

## What does it do?

CraftWeek analyzes your Craft daily notes over a selected period (7, 14, or 30 days) and generates a structured weekly reflection including:

- Key Themes
- Decisions Made
- Open Loops
- Next Actions
- Insights & Patterns

The result is saved directly into today's Craft daily note.

## Why Craft?

Craft is both the source and the destination:
